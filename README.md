# Multinomial-Logistic-Regression
Building a Multinomial Logistic Regression model that predicts the spending class of a customer based on the products purchased and attributes of the customer.

I analysed customer data from Fresco Supermarket and identified trends and patterns. The data used for this analysis was collected from several of their loyalty cardholders during a 26-week period. The data includes information on the customers’ gender, age, shopping frequency per week and shopping basket price. 

The shopping basket price was categorized into three categories: Low spender for values of £25 or less, medium spender for values between £25.01 and £70 and high spender for values greater than £70.  
Multinomial logistic regression model was built, with the target or dependent variable being the spending category and the predictors or independent variable being the age of the customer, store type, value of value products, value of brand products and value of Top Fresco products purchased by the customer. 

The model correctly classified 83% of customers that are low spenders, 76% of customers that are medium spenders and 87% of customers that are high spenders. The model was 82% accurate in predicting the customers spending category.
